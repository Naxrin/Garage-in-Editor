# Garage In Editor

This mod does nothing but adds an extra entry rope button in *EditLevelLayer* (the layer menu where you edit&play&publish your level),
And the rope does wholly the same thing with the one in *LevelInfoLayer* (entrance of a saved level).

### Settings
The only mod option *Transparent Texture Fit* is meant to fit some texture packs which set the two deep blue frames to Transparent, the rope's position is set to (484, 295) if Enabled and (492, 295) if Disabled.

In the LevelInfoLayer Robtop sets the garageRope's position to (484, 295), but seeing from the image below, if it's still set to my added one, it's too close to a deep blue title frame and look bad.
