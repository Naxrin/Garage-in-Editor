# <cy>Garage In Editor</c>
This mod does nothing but adds an extra entry rope button in
- **EditLevelLayer** (the menu where you edit / play / publish your level)
- **LevelSelectLayer** (the official levels browser, optional)  
And the rope does exactly the same as the one in **LevelInfoLayer** (entrance of a saved level) does.

### <cy>Settings</c>
#### <cy>Placement Offset</c>
Moves the added rope left or right regarding the value is set to negative or positive.
#### <cy>Transparent Texture Fit</c>
Removes the two blue frames to avoid them getting covered by the garage rope and makes the UI looks bad.
